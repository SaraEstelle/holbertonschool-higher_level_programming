# Python - Hello, World

## Description
This project is an introduction to Python scripting at Holberton School. It focuses on using the Python interpreter, printing text and variables, working with strings (including indexing and slicing), and following the official Python coding style with **pycodestyle** (PEP8 / PyCode).

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using `print()`
- How to use strings in Python
- What indexing and slicing are
- What the official Python coding style is and how to check code with `pycodestyle`

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python version: `python3` (3.8.*)
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files must be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All files must be executable
- Code style: `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- File length will be tested using `wc`
- A `README.md` is required:
  - at the root of the repository
  - at the root of this project directory

## Repository
- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-higher_level_programming`
- Project directory: `python-hello_world`
